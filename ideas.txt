
Ideas for possible (future) developments...

- make it possible to substitute a B: drive when said drive is ghosted by DOS
  (typical situation of single-drive setups)

- add a separate signal for CF in the protocol, so it is possible to set a
  non-zero AH while keeping CF zeroed at the same time - this would be useful
  for responding to int 13h,ah=15h (get disk type)

- some hotkey to automatically swap disks... this would be tricky to
  implement, as it would probably require a redesign of the TSR. I don't need
  such feature, but can see how it could be useful for games that ask "please
  insert disk number 2"

- option for stealing a write lock (diskette "forgotten" in another PC)

- formatting support (with dynamic resizing of the floppy image)

- deleting a diskette should issue a prompt ("are you sure?")

- some kind of server-side management interface to force ejecting/inserting
  floppy images to clients (could be used as a poor man's way of diskette
  swapping)

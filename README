Description:

  ethflop is a DOS TSR that emulates a floppy disk drive. The emulated (virtual)
  floppy disk is, in fact, stored on a BSD or Linux server as a floppy image.

  This is version https://sourceforge.net/p/ethflop/code/67/tree/trunk plus
  port to FreeBSD, DragonFly, OpenBSD, NetBSD and musl / Alpine Linux, reduced
  DOS TSR resident footprint (2016 -> 1984 bytes) and some other patches by me.

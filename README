Description:

  ethflop is a DOS TSR that emulates a floppy disk drive. The emulated (virtual)
  floppy disk is, in fact, stored on a FreeBSD, OpenBSD, NetBSD or Linux server
  as a floppy image.

  This is version https://sourceforge.net/p/ethflop/code/67/tree/trunk plus
  FreeBSD port, OpenBSD port, NetBSD port, musl / Alpine Linux port, reduced DOS
  TSR resident footprint (2016 -> 1984 bytes) and some other patches by me.

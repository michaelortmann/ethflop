ethflop is a DOS TSR that emulates a floppy disk drive. The emulated (virtual)
floppy disk is, in fact, stored on a FreeBSD, OpenBSD or Linux server as a
floppy image.

This is version https://sourceforge.net/p/ethflop/code/67/tree/trunk/ plus
FreeBSD and OpenBSD port and some other patches by me.

Thanks and Greetings to Mateusz Viste.

Enjoy,
